## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Web Scraping Architecture**

```typescript
// Robust Puppeteer-based scraping with anti-detection
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: true,
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled']
});

// Smart rate limiting and error handling
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
```

### **AI Lead Scoring Algorithm**

```typescript
// Multi-factor scoring system
const enhancedScore =
  (industryScore * 0.25) +
  (freightVolumeScore * 0.30) +
  (companySizeScore * 0.20) +
  (locationScore * 0.15) +
  (contactScore * 0.05) +
  (fmcsaScore * 0.05);
```

### **FMCSA Cross-Reference**

```typescript
// Automatic carrier relationship detection
const fmcsaMatches = await this.fmcsaService.searchByCompanyName(companyName);
const relationship = this.inferCarrierRelationship(fmcsaData);
```

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **High-Value Manufacturer Discovery**

```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/thomas-net', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'freight_focused_search',
    location: 'Texas'
  })
});
```

### **Industry-Specific Search**

```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/thomas-net', {
