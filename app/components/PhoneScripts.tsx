      problemIdentification: `We noticed that [Specific Carrier Name]'s insurance is expiring on [Date], which puts [X]% of your shipments at immediate risk. This could mean:

â€¢ Carrier loses operating authority
â€¢ Deliveries delayed by 3-5 days
â€¢ $50K+ in expedited shipping costs
â€¢ Compliance violations and fines
â€¢ Customer satisfaction issues

Are you aware of this situation?`,

      solutionPresentation: `We're a licensed freight broker specializing in crisis situations like yours. We have immediate capacity available from fully-insured carriers and can seamlessly replace your at-risk carrier:

âœ… **Immediate capacity**: Available within 24 hours
âœ… **Rate protection**: No price increases during transition
âœ… **Compliance guarantee**: Full DOT/SAFETY certification
âœ… **Dedicated support**: Single point of contact
âœ… **Service continuity**: Zero disruption to your operations`,

      objectionHandling: `I understand you may be hesitant to make changes during a crisis. The beauty of our approach is we handle everything - you maintain the same service levels while we manage the transition. We've helped 150+ companies in similar situations avoid any service disruptions.

[If they mention timing]: "This is exactly why we're calling now - we can prevent the crisis before it affects your operations."

[If they mention cost]: "Our rates are competitive and we offer rate-lock protection during the transition period."

[If they mention current carrier]: "We respect your existing relationships. Our goal is to ensure continuity while you address this insurance issue."`,

      callToAction: `To prevent any disruption, I'd like to schedule a brief 15-minute call with our crisis response team tomorrow. We can review your specific carrier situation and present immediate capacity options.

What time works best for you tomorrow - morning or afternoon?`,

      closing: `Thank you for your time. Carrier insurance issues don't wait, and neither should your solution. I'll follow up with an email confirming our conversation and including some resources about carrier insurance requirements.

      problemIdentification: `I wanted to make sure you fully understand the risks. When [Carrier]'s insurance expires on [Date], they could:

â€¢ Lose their operating authority overnight
â€¢ Have shipments rejected at state lines
â€¢ Face immediate fines from FMCSA
â€¢ Leave you without transportation capacity

This happened to [Similar Company] last quarter - they lost $75K in one week due to expedited shipping costs alone.`,

      solutionPresentation: `We specialize in these exact situations and have helped prevent 150+ carrier crises this year. Our crisis response program includes:

ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Assessment**: Free analysis of your carrier dependencies
ðŸŽ¯ **Backup Capacity**: Pre-qualified carriers ready to deploy
ðŸŽ¯ **Rate Protection**: Locked-in rates during transition
ðŸŽ¯ **Compliance Assurance**: Full regulatory protection
ðŸŽ¯ **Dedicated Support**: 24/7 crisis management team

We're not just another broker - we're crisis prevention specialists.`,

      objectionHandling: `I completely understand your concerns. Let me address that directly:

[If they say "We're happy with our current carrier"]: "That's great to hear. We're not here to replace a good carrier, but to protect you from the insurance risk. Think of us as insurance for your transportation."

[If they say "We don't have time for this"]: "I completely understand - that's why we handle everything. You focus on your business while we manage the transition."

[If they say "This sounds expensive"]: "Actually, most of our clients save money because we eliminate expedited shipping costs and provide better long-term rates."`,

      callToAction: `I'd love to show you how we've helped companies just like yours. Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call with one of our clients who went through a similar situation? Or would you prefer I send you their case study first?

What works better for your schedule?`,

      closing: `Thank you for taking my call. I'll send you that case study within the next hour. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about [Carrier]'s situation.

Looking forward to speaking with you soon.

â€¢ **Service disruption**: 40% of your shipments affected
â€¢ **Cost explosion**: $50K+ in emergency shipping
â€¢ **Customer impact**: Delivery delays and complaints
â€¢ **Compliance risk**: FMCSA fines and penalties
â€¢ **Competitive disadvantage**: While others are protected

Time is running out to avoid this becoming a crisis.`,

This isn't just insurance - it's proactive protection that pays for itself.`,

[If budget is the issue]: "Our protection program actually saves most clients money within the first 30 days by eliminating expedited shipping costs."

[If they're still evaluating]: "I understand the decision process. Let me ask - what's the one thing holding you back from moving forward today?"

[If they mention timing]: "Perfect timing actually works in your favor. We can implement this before [Carrier]'s expiration becomes critical."

      closing: `Thank you for your time and consideration. The clock is ticking on [Carrier]'s insurance, and prevention is always better than crisis management.
