[If they say "We're handling it ourselves"]: "That's impressive! Many founders start that way. The challenge comes when volume picks up and shipping becomes a bottleneck. We've helped businesses avoid that by having a reliable partner in place from day one."

[If they ask about the time commitment]: "We start with flexible month-to-month arrangements. As you grow, we can adjust to annual contracts with better rates."
