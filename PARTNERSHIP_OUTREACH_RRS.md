Subject: FleetFlow LaunchPad Partnership Opportunity - MC Authority Referrals

Dear Rapid Registration Services Partnership Team,

My name is Dee Davis, Founder of FleetFlow and creator of DEPOINTE AI. I'm reaching out about an exciting partnership opportunity that could significantly benefit both our organizations.

**About FleetFlow LaunchPad:**
We're launching an innovative coaching platform for aspiring freight brokers that combines AI-powered mentorship with comprehensive licensing support. Our LaunchPad program guides students through MC authority applications, insurance setup, and business formation - all while earning their first loads.

**The Partnership Opportunity:**
We'd like to integrate your MC Authority services as our primary affiliate partner. Your proven track record (98% approval rate, 21-day average processing) makes you the perfect fit for our students' licensing needs.

**Mutual Benefits:**
For Rapid Registration Services:
- Steady stream of pre-qualified leads (we've already identified 500+ interested students)
- 20-30% commission per successful application
- Automated referral tracking via ClickBank integration
- Co-branded marketing materials and joint webinars

For FleetFlow LaunchPad:
- Reduced student acquisition costs through affiliate commissions
- Faster MC approval process for our students (21 days vs industry average 45 days)
- Credibility boost through partnership with established FMCSA service provider
- Additional revenue stream from affiliate commissions

**Technical Integration:**
We're ready to implement:
- ClickBank affiliate tracking pixels
- API webhooks for real-time status updates
- Co-branded application forms
- Automated commission processing

**Next Steps:**
I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss this opportunity in detail. Are you available this week or next?

Looking forward to potentially working together to make freight broker licensing easier for aspiring professionals.

Best regards,
Dee Davis

## üìû **Phone Script - Follow-up Call**

### **Opening (First 30 seconds):**

```
"Hi [Contact Name], this is Dee Davis from FleetFlow following up on my email about our LaunchPad partnership opportunity. Did you have a chance to review the proposal I sent?"
```

### **Value Proposition (2-3 minutes):**

```
"We're launching LaunchPad to solve a major problem in the freight industry - new brokers struggle with licensing complexity. Your MC Authority services are perfect for our students because:

1. Your 98% approval rate gives our students confidence
2. 21-day processing time fits our 90-day program timeline perfectly
3. ClickBank integration makes referral tracking seamless
4. Your established reputation adds credibility to our program

We project 200-500 students in our first year, which could mean $15K-30K in affiliate commissions for you annually."
```

### **Technical Discussion (3-4 minutes):**

```
"We're ready to integrate immediately:
- ClickBank affiliate links in our coaching emails
- Webhook notifications for application status updates
- Co-branded landing pages for better conversion
- Real-time commission dashboard for both teams

Our CTO has already reviewed your API documentation and confirmed compatibility with our platform."
```

### **Objection Handling:**

#### **"We're not looking for new partners right now"**

```
"I completely understand. However, our market research shows a significant gap in the freight broker licensing space. We specifically chose Rapid Registration Services because of your reputation and success rates. Would you be open to exploring this after your current priorities?"
```

#### **"Our commissions are competitive"**

```
"We love your commission structure - 20-30% is excellent for the value you provide. We're projecting 200 students in our first 6 months, which would generate $10K-18K in commissions for you. Plus, these are qualified leads who are motivated to complete licensing."
```

#### **"We need to see your platform first"**

```
"Absolutely! I'd be happy to schedule a demo. We have a working prototype with 20 test students already enrolled. I can show you the student journey, integration points, and projected referral volumes."
```

### **Closing:**

```
"Great discussion! Based on what we've covered, I think there's strong potential here. Let me send over our formal partnership agreement template for your review. What would be the best next step from your side?"
