# Image Integration Instructions

## Step 1: Save Your Images

Please save your two images to the following locations:

1. **Logistics Scene Image**: Save as `/Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW/public/images/logistics-hero.jpg`
   - This will be used as a hero background and section banner

2. **FleetFlow Logo**: Save as `/Users/deedavis/FLEETFLOW/public/images/fleetflow-logo.png`
   - This will replace the current text-based logo

## Step 2: Run the Integration

After saving the images, I'll integrate them into:
- Dashboard hero section with the logistics scene as background
- New logo component using your custom FleetFlow logo
- Section backgrounds and branding elements
- Login/welcome screens (if needed)

The integration will maintain the current dark, command-center aesthetic while adding your branded visuals for maximum impact.
