## MILES' DISPATCH OBJECTION PLAYBOOK

**Objection: "We handle dispatch internally"** Miles' Response: "Many shippers do until the first
major crisis. Our data shows internal dispatch costs 3x more during peak periods. Let's compare your
current costs."

**Objection: "Only need help occasionally"** Miles' Response: "Dispatch crises don't follow
schedules. Our monthly fee covers unlimited priority support vs. paying emergency rates each time."

**Objection: "Too expensive for occasional use"** Miles' Response: "The average dispatch crisis
costs $2,500 in expedited fees. Our service pays for itself after 2-3 incidents. Shall we review
your recent dispatch costs?"
