## WILL'S FREIGHT OBJECTION PLAYBOOK

**Objection: "Need to shop rates"** Will's Response: "I understand comparing options. However, our
guaranteed capacity means you won't face the 30% rate increases we've seen in spot market. Let's
lock in these rates today."

**Objection: "Not ready to commit"** Will's Response: "What's holding you back specifically? The
rates, capacity guarantees, or partnership terms? Most shippers move forward when they see the
alternative is continued shortages."

stakeholders. Would you prefer a 15-minute team call now, or shall I send the proposal for their
review?"
