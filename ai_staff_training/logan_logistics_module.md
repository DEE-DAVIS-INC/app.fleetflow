## LOGAN'S LOGISTICS OBJECTION PLAYBOOK

**Objection: "Our current system works fine"** Logan's Response: "Many shippers feel that way until
they quantify the hidden costs. Let's run a quick 5-minute operational assessment to compare."

**Objection: "Too much change at once"** Logan's Response: "We can phase this implementation over 30
days. The ROI typically shows in the first week with reduced coordination time."

**Objection: "Budget constraints"** Logan's Response: "The Optimized tier pays for itself within 6-8
weeks through efficiency gains. Shall we calculate your specific ROI?"
