## SECTION I: FREIGHT BROKERAGE MINDSET

### The Elite Freight Closer Mindset

1. **The First Call is the Best Call**
   - Trust, urgency, and momentum peak at initial contact
   - Every follow-up reduces close probability by 25-35%
   - "Ghosting" in freight = lost capacity and margins

2. **Own the Outcome, Control the Process**
   - Never blame carriers, shippers, or market conditions
   - Focus on: "What could I have done differently?"
   - Control > Excuses in freight operations

3. **Train Like a Champion**
   - Daily role-play freight scenarios
   - Study successful DEPOINTE closes
   - Track personal KPIs: conversion rate, average contract value, call efficiency

4. **Guide the Conversation**
   - Never let shippers shop indefinitely
   - Set agendas: "Let's discuss your capacity needs, review options, and secure your preferred
     carriers"
   - Handle objections as buying signals

5. **Bring Freight Authority**
   - Demonstrate deep industry knowledge
   - Reference real carrier networks and compliance expertise
   - Confidence transfers to shippers

## SECTION II: THE 8-STEP FREIGHT CLOSE SYSTEM

### STEP 1: PRE-FRAME THE FREIGHT MISSION

**Goal**: Set expectations before the call begins

**Freight-Specific Scripts:**

- **Email Pre-Frame**: "Hi [Shipper], this is [AI Staff Name] from DEPOINTE. We'll discuss your
  freight needs, review carrier options, and if everything aligns, secure your preferred
  partnerships today."
- **Call Pre-Frame**: "Most shippers make confident carrier decisions during our initial
  consultation to lock in capacity and rates."

**Why It Works in Freight:**

- Shippers expect multiple quotes and delays
- Pre-framing eliminates shopping mentality
- Creates urgency around capacity and rates

### STEP 2: BUILD INSTANT FREIGHT TRUST

**Goal**: Establish credibility in first 30 seconds

**Freight Authority Statements:**

- "DEPOINTE moves $50M+ annually with 99.7% on-time delivery"
- "We maintain partnerships with 200+ carriers across North America"
- "Our FMCSA compliance rating and insurance coverage ensure your shipments are protected"

**Industry-Specific Trust Builders:**

- Reference specific carrier networks
- Mention digital tracking capabilities
- Highlight compliance expertise
- Share recent successful shipments

### STEP 3: SURFACE FREIGHT PAIN

**Goal**: Uncover shipper challenges to create urgency

**Freight Pain Discovery Questions:**

- "What's your biggest challenge with carrier capacity right now?"
- "How often are you dealing with rate increases or fuel surcharges?"
- "What's the impact of shipment delays on your business?"
- "How much time are you spending on compliance paperwork?"

**Freight-Specific Pain Points:**

- Carrier shortages during peak seasons
- Rate volatility and hidden fees
- Tracking and visibility issues
- Compliance and documentation headaches
- Inefficient dispatch processes

### STEP 4: FUTURE-PACE FREIGHT SUCCESS

**Goal**: Help shippers visualize the transformation

**Freight Future-Pacing Examples:**

- "Imagine never worrying about capacity again..."
- "Picture shipments moving predictably with real-time tracking..."
- "See your margins staying consistent without rate surprises..."
- "Visualize your team focusing on core business instead of logistics firefighting..."

**Freight Value Anchoring:**

- Highlight compliance and insurance benefits

### STEP 6: ASK FOR THE FREIGHT CLOSE

**Goal**: Secure commitment while momentum is high

**Freight Close Scripts:**

- "Based on your capacity needs and our carrier network, shall we secure these partnerships today?"
- "If we can lock in these rates and capacity commitments, are you ready to move forward?"
- "Would you like to activate your DEPOINTE logistics partnership now?"

**Freight Objection Handling:**

- "Need to shop rates?" → "Let's compare our guaranteed capacity vs. spot market volatility"
- "Need team approval?" → "Most logistics decisions involve stakeholders - shall we schedule a quick
  team call?"

### STEP 7: SECURE THE FREIGHT CONTRACT

**Goal**: Convert verbal agreement to signed commitment

**Freight Documentation Process:**

- Digital carrier agreements
- Brokerage partnership contracts
- Service level agreements
- Compliance and insurance paperwork

**Freight Momentum Maintenance:**

- "Let's get these carrier agreements signed so we can activate your preferred capacity"
- "I'll walk you through the partnership terms and get everything locked in"

### STEP 8: CEMENT FREIGHT COMMITMENT

**Goal**: Eliminate buyer's remorse and build long-term partnership

**Freight Follow-Through:**

- Immediate onboarding call scheduling
- Carrier introduction and preference setup
- Digital portal access and training
- First shipment coordination

**Freight Referral Generation:**

- "Most shippers refer us to their logistics partners"
- "Who else in your network deals with freight challenges?"

## SECTION III: FREIGHT OBJECTION HANDLING MASTER SHEET

### Common Freight Objections & Responses:

**"We're getting other quotes"**

- Response: "Makes sense to compare. Let's ensure you're comparing guaranteed capacity and
  compliance support, not just rates."

**"Need to talk to my logistics team"**

- Response: "Most freight decisions involve stakeholders. Would you prefer we schedule a 15-minute
  team call now?"

**"Rates are too high"**

- Response: "Let's break this down: our rates include guaranteed capacity, full compliance support,
  and real-time tracking - what's your current cost of carrier shortages?"

**"Not ready to commit today"**

- Response: "I understand. What's holding you back - is it the rates, capacity guarantees, or
  partnership terms?"

**"Prefer to use our current carriers"**

- Response: "We can certainly work with your preferred carriers. Shall we formalize the partnership
  to ensure priority capacity and better rates?"
