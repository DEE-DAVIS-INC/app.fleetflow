# FleetFlow Access Control System

## Overview
The FleetFlow dashboard now includes a comprehensive access control system that separates sensitive management information from general fleet operations. This ensures that financial data, analytics, and administrative functions are only accessible to authorized personnel.

## User Roles & Permissions

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Driver** - Basic access to essential fleet information
2. **Dispatcher** - Operational access including dispatch and routing
3. **Manager** - Full operational + management dashboard access
4. **Admin** - Complete system access including settings

### Permission Matrix
| Feature | Driver | Dispatcher | Manager | Admin |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|-------|
| Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dispatch Central | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Broker Box | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Fleet Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Analytics** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Financials** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| System Settings | ❌ | ❌ | Limited | ✅ |

## Implementation Details

### Navigation Changes
- **Management Dropdown**: Analytics and Financials are now grouped in a restricted "🔒 Management" section
- **Visual Indicators**: The management dropdown has a red accent border and lock icon to indicate restricted access
- **Role-based Welcome**: Navigation displays the user's role (e.g., "Welcome, Manager")
- **Conditional Display**: Management dropdown only appears for Manager and Admin roles

### Page-Level Protection
- **Access Restrictions**: Analytics and Financials pages check permissions before rendering
- **Custom Error Pages**: Users without access see a professional access denied message
- **Graceful Fallback**: "Go Back" button allows users to return to authorized areas

### Centralized Configuration
- **Single Source**: All access control logic is centralized in `/app/config/access.ts`
- **Easy Role Changes**: Update `currentUserRole` to test different access levels
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new roles and permissions as needed

## Testing Access Levels

To test different access levels, modify the `currentUserRole` in `/app/config/access.ts`:

```typescript
const currentUserRole: UserRole = 'driver';    // Restricted access
const currentUserRole: UserRole = 'manager';   // Full access
const currentUserRole: UserRole = 'admin';     // Complete access
```

## Security Features

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Role-based navigation visibility
- ✅ Page-level access controls
- ✅ Professional access denied pages
- ✅ Centralized permission management

### Production Considerations
- 🔄 **Auth Integration**: Replace mock roles with real authentication system
- 🔄 **Session Management**: Implement proper session handling
- 🔄 **API Protection**: Secure backend endpoints with same permission logic
- 🔄 **Audit Logging**: Track access attempts to sensitive data

## Sensitive Data Protection

### Protected Sections
1. **Fleet Analytics** 📊
   - Revenue and profitability metrics
   - Driver performance analytics
   - Vehicle utilization reports
   - Route efficiency analysis

2. **Financial Management** 💰
   - Invoice generation and tracking
   - Expense management
   - Financial reporting
   - Revenue analysis

### Access Denial Messages
Each protected section has customized messaging explaining:
- What type of sensitive data is protected
- Why access is restricted
- What permission level is required

## Usage Instructions

### For Managers/Admins
1. Look for the "🔒 Management" dropdown in the navigation
2. Access Analytics for performance insights
3. Use Financials for invoice and expense management
4. All features remain fully functional with enhanced security

### For Drivers/Dispatchers
- All operational features remain accessible
- Management functions are hidden from navigation
- Direct URL access is blocked with helpful messaging
- Settings remain available for basic configuration

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with enterprise authentication systems (SAML, OAuth, etc.)
- Granular permissions (e.g., read-only financial access)
- Multi-tenant support for fleet management companies
- Audit trail for sensitive data access
- Time-based access controls
