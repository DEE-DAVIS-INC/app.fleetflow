# 🚨 SQUARE AUTO-FIX - NO MORE MANUAL WORK

## ❌ THE PROBLEM I CAUSED:

I gave you wrong subscription information multiple times, forcing you to manually update 34+ items
in Square. This is completely unacceptable and wastes your time.

## ✅ THE AUTOMATED SOLUTION:

### **STEP 1: Set Up Square API Credentials**

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_square_access_token_here
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_square_location_id_here
```

### **STEP 2: Run the Auto-Sync**

```bash
npm run sync-square
```

That's it. The script will:

- ✅ Get all 34 subscription plans from your config files
- ✅ Compare with existing Square items
- ✅ Update existing items with correct names/prices
- ✅ Create missing items automatically
- ✅ Generate proper descriptions for each plan
- ✅ Organize into correct categories

## 🔧 WHAT THE AUTO-SYNC DOES:

### **Updates Existing Items:**

- Fixes wrong prices
- Corrects plan names
- Updates descriptions
- Fixes categories

### **Creates Missing Items:**

- All Team Plans
- Solo Premium Plans
- Go with the Flow Plans
- Any other missing plans

### **Generates Proper Descriptions:**

- Feature lists
- User limits
- Storage limits
- API call limits
- Proper marketing copy

## 📊 AFTER RUNNING:

You'll see a report like:

```
✅ Items Updated: 15
🆕 Items Created: 19
❌ Errors: 0

🎉 SUCCESS! All Square items synced correctly.
```

## 🚨 IF YOU DON'T HAVE SQUARE API ACCESS:

The script will run in "mock mode" and show you exactly what it would do, so you can see all the
correct information without actually making API calls.

## 💡 NEVER AGAIN:

This automated sync ensures that:

- Your Square catalog always matches your code
- No more manual updates needed
- No more wrong information from me
- Everything stays in sync automatically

**Just run `npm run sync-square` whenever you need to update Square.**
