## 🎯 **What Happens Next:**

### **Real Upload Flow (No More Simulation!):**
```
📸 Driver selects photo → Uploads to Cloudinary → Real URL returned
✍️ Driver signs → Signature uploaded → Stored permanently  
🚚 Delivery photos → Organized by driver/load → CDN delivery
```

### **File Organization:**
```
📁 Your Cloudinary Media Library:
├── 📁 fleetflow/
│   ├── 📁 confirmation/
│   │   └── 📁 DRV-2025-001/
│   │       └── confirmation_1704234567890.jpg
│   ├── 📁 pickup/
│   │   └── 📁 DRV-2025-001/
│   ├── 📁 delivery/
│   │   └── 📁 DRV-2025-001/
│   └── 📁 signatures/
│       └── 📁 DRV-2025-001/
```
