# FreightFlow Bid Information Sources 📊

## Current Data Sources (Development Mode)

### 🎯 **Bid Strategy Generation**
Currently using **intelligent mock algorithms** that simulate real market conditions:

```typescript
recommendedRate: marketAverage * 0.95  // 5% below market average
winProbability: 30-70%                 // Based on competitive positioning
targetMargin: 15%                      // Standard freight margin
costAnalysis: marketRate * 0.8         // 80% cost ratio
```

### 📈 **Market Intelligence**
Mock data simulating real market sources:
- **Lane-specific rates** (origin → destination)
- **Equipment availability** and premiums
- **Seasonal multipliers** (peak vs off-peak)

## 📊 **Bid Calculation Algorithm**

### **Step 1: Market Analysis**
```typescript
1. Gather lane-specific rates from multiple sources
2. Calculate market average with confidence weights
3. Analyze demand trends and capacity constraints
4. Apply seasonal and equipment-specific adjustments
```

### **Step 2: Cost Calculation**
```typescript
1. Base transportation cost (fuel, driver, equipment)
2. Route-specific factors (tolls, permits, difficulty)
3. Risk premiums (weather, security, timing)
4. Overhead allocation (insurance, admin, profit)
```

### **Step 3: Competitive Positioning**
```typescript
1. Analyze competitor rates on similar lanes
2. Apply company positioning strategy:
   - AGGRESSIVE: 2-5% below market
   - BALANCED: Market rate ±2%
   - PREMIUM: 3-8% above market with value-adds
```

### **Step 4: Win Probability**
```typescript
1. Historical win rates on similar RFx
2. Customer relationship strength
3. Service differentiation factors
4. Price competitiveness score
```
