# üõ°Ô∏è UPDATED: Top Insurance Partners with VIABLE Commissions

## Confirmed Partnership Programs (Excluding Low-Commission Options)

### **üö´ NEXT Insurance Update:**

**You're absolutely right to reject NEXT Insurance!** $25 per quote is not viable for LaunchPad's
business model. I've updated this list to focus on insurance companies with competitive commission
rates.
