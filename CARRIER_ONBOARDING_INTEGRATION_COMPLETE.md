## Data Integration Flow

### Onboarding Completion

When a carrier completes the onboarding process:

1. **Data Collection**: All step data is aggregated into an `OnboardingRecord`
2. **Integration Service**: `OnboardingIntegrationService.completeOnboarding()` is called
3. **Profile Creation**:
   - Carrier portal profile is created
   - Driver portal profiles are created for each driver
4. **Notification**: Welcome notifications are sent (mock implementation)
5. **Portal Access**: Accounts are activated and ready for use

### Data Models

#### CarrierPortalProfile

```typescript
interface CarrierPortalProfile {
  carrierId: string;
  companyInfo: CompanyInfo;
  onboardingDate: string;
  status: 'active' | 'suspended' | 'under_review';
  factoring?: FactoringInfo;
  documents: DocumentInfo[];
  agreements: AgreementInfo[];
  portalAccess: PortalAccessInfo;
  performance: PerformanceMetrics;
}
```

#### DriverPortalProfile

```typescript
interface DriverPortalProfile {
  driverId: string;
  carrierId: string;
  personalInfo: PersonalInfo;
  employmentInfo: EmploymentInfo;

## Conclusion

The carrier onboarding workflow system provides a comprehensive solution for managing the entire
carrier lifecycle from initial verification through ongoing portal access. The modular design allows
for easy extension and customization while maintaining data integrity and proper access controls
throughout the process.

The integration between onboarding and portal systems ensures seamless data flow and eliminates
duplicate data entry, providing a superior user experience for both internal staff and external
carriers and drivers.
