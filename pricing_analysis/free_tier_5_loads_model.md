## üí∞ ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: 5 LOADS WITH SAFEGUARDS

### Exploitation Risk Assessment:

```
5 loads √ó $750 max = $3,750 total value (vs $7,500 before)
Platform costs: $150/load √ó 5 = $750 (reduced services)
Carrier payout: 93% √ó $3,750 = $3,488
PLATFORM COSTS: $750 (covered by conversions)
```

### Conversion Economics:

```
Free users: 200 (5 loads each)
Expected conversions: 25% = 50 paying customers
Revenue from conversions: $14,950/month
Cost coverage: 200% (costs paid by conversions)
```
