# Dispatch Central Page Issues Fixed ✅

## Problems Identified & Resolved

### 1. **Empty White Boxes Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** The stats cards and load table were showing empty or zero values
**Root Cause:** Limited mock data in the system
**Solution:** 
- Added comprehensive mock data with 6 diverse loads
- Loads now include various statuses: Available, Assigned, In Transit, Delivered
- Each load has complete shipper information
- Different brokers, dispatchers, and equipment types represented

### 2. **Whitewashed/Invisible Tabs Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Tab buttons were appearing washed out or not showing proper colors
**Root Cause:** Dynamic CSS class generation wasn't working reliably
**Solution:**
- Replaced dynamic class generation with explicit button definitions
- Each tab now has hardcoded, reliable color classes:
  - Load Board: Blue (`bg-blue-600`)
  - Add Shipment: Green (`bg-green-600`) 
  - Live Tracking: Purple (`bg-purple-600`)
  - Route Generator: Emerald (`bg-emerald-600`)
  - Carrier Verification: Cyan (`bg-cyan-600`)
  - Admin Controls: Gray (`bg-gray-600`)

### 3. **Enhanced Debug Logging** ✅ ADDED
- Added comprehensive console logging to help troubleshoot data flow
- Console now shows: user info, permissions, load counts, and actual load data
