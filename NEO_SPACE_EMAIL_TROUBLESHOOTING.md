# Neo.space Email Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: Email Connection Failed

Your AI Executive Assistant (Alexis Best) cannot connect to `ddavis@freight1stdirect.com` because of
authentication restrictions.

## 🔧 **SOLUTION: Disable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

Based on
[Neo.space documentation](https://support.neo.space/hc/en-us/articles/14463215360281-Configure-Neo-Mail-on-Outlook),
you need to **disable 2FA** to allow third-party email clients (like our AI assistant).

### **Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Go to Neo.space Login**: https://app.neo.space/mail/
2. **Log in** with your credentials:
   - Email: `ddavis@freight1stdirect.com`
   - Password: `D13@sha1$$`
3. **Navigate to Security Settings**
4. **Disable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
5. **Save changes**

### **Alternative: App-Specific Password**

If you prefer to keep 2FA enabled:

1. Create an **app-specific password** in Neo.space settings
2. Use that password instead of your main password in the AI system

## 📧 **Confirmed Settings (Already Configured)**

Your AI system is correctly configured with:

```
IMAP Server: imap0001.neo.space (Port 993, SSL)
SMTP Server: smtp0001.neo.space (Port 465, SSL)
Email: ddavis@freight1stdirect.com
Password: D13@sha1$$
```

## 📊 **Neo.space Email Limits**

Be aware of these limits for your AI assistant:

- **Outgoing**: 25 emails/hour, 50 emails/day
- **Incoming**: 500 emails/hour, 1000 emails/day

## 🧪 **Test After Fixing 2FA**

Once you've disabled 2FA:

1. **Test the connection**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai-communication/config
   ```

2. **Activate Alexis Best**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai-communication/setup \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "setup_alexis"}'
   ```

3. **Check status**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/ai-communication/setup
   ```

## ✅ **Expected Success Response**

After fixing 2FA, you should see:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "emailTest": {
      "success": true,
      "message": "Successfully connected to ddavis@freight1stdirect.com",
      "emailAddress": "ddavis@freight1stdirect.com",
      "provider": "Neo.space"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **What Alexis Best Will Do Once Connected**

- **Monitor**: `ddavis@freight1stdirect.com` inbox
- **Prioritize**: Freight/logistics emails
- **Categorize**: Customer vs vendor vs internal emails
- **Draft**: Professional responses for your approval
- **Alert**: Urgent freight matters
- **Organize**: Email threads by topic/customer

## 🔍 **Still Having Issues?**

If problems persist after disabling 2FA:

1. **Check Neo.space server status**
2. **Verify password hasn't changed**
3. **Try logging into https://app.neo.space/mail/ manually**
4. **Contact Neo.space support** if needed

## 📱 **Next: Optional Phone Integration**

Once email is working, you can optionally set up:

- **Twilio account** for Charin (AI Receptionist)
- **Phone answering capabilities**
- **SMS notifications**

**The main blocker is the 2FA setting in your Neo.space account. Disable it and Alexis Best will be
ready to manage your freight emails!** 🚛📧
