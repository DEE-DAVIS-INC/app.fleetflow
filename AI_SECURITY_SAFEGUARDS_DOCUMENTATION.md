## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE**

### Quick Start Integration

#### 1. Enable AI Security Middleware

```typescript
// In your AI route handlers
import { aiSecurityMiddleware } from '../middleware/aiSecurityMiddleware';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  return aiSecurityMiddleware(request, async (secureRequest) => {
    // Your AI processing logic here
    // All security checks have been passed
    return processAIRequest(secureRequest);
  });
}
```

#### 2. Configure User Roles

```typescript
import { aiRoleBasedAccessService } from '../services/AIRoleBasedAccessService';

// Assign roles to users
aiRoleBasedAccessService.assignUserToRole('user123', 'dispatcher');
aiRoleBasedAccessService.assignUserToRole('user456', 'manager');
```

#### 3. Set Up Tenant Contexts

```typescript
import { aiTenantIsolationService } from '../services/AITenantIsolationService';

// Register tenant with security context
aiTenantIsolationService.registerTenant({
  tenantId: 'company-abc',
  tier: 'premium',
  features: ['ai_analytics', 'customer_support'],
  dataClassification: 'confidential',
  complianceRequirements: ['GDPR', 'CCPA']
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Custom Security Policies

```typescript
import { aiSecurityService } from '../services/AISecurityService';

// Create custom policy for specific use case
aiSecurityService.addSecurityPolicy({
  id: 'policy_custom_broker',
  name: 'Custom Broker Policy',
  allowedOperations: ['ai.rate_analysis', 'ai.market_intel'],
  blockedPatterns: [/competitor\s+secrets/i],
  maxTokens: 5000,
  tenantIsolation: true,
  auditLevel: 'detailed'
});
```

#### Custom Sensitive Patterns

```typescript
import { aiResponseFilter } from '../services/AIResponseFilter';

// Add custom pattern for specific industry terms
aiResponseFilter.addCustomPattern({
  name: 'Proprietary Route',
  pattern: /route\s+code\s+[A-Z0-9]{6,}/gi,
  replacement: '[ROUTE_CODE_REDACTED]',
  severity: 'high',
  category: 'proprietary',
  complianceRelevant: ['TRADE_SECRET']
});
```

### Testing & Validation

#### Security Testing Framework

```typescript
// Test AI security controls
const testResult = aiResponseFilter.testResponse(
  "Customer John Doe (SSN: 123-45-6789) has account 987654321",
  {
    userRole: 'dispatcher',
    context: 'customer_facing',
    dataAccessLevel: 'internal',
    complianceRequirements: ['GDPR', 'CCPA'],
    filterLevel: 'standard'
  }
);

console.log(testResult.filteredResponse);
// "Customer [EMAIL_REDACTED] ([SSN_REDACTED]) has account [ACCOUNT_NUMBER_REDACTED]"
```
