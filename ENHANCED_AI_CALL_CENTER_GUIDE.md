## 🏗️ **Architecture Components**

### **1. Core AI Services**

#### **FreightConversationAI** (`app/services/FreightConversationAI.ts`)

```typescript
// Main conversation engine with freight-specific intelligence
class FreightConversationAI {
  // Handles all conversation stages
  async processCarrierCall(userInput: string, context: FreightCallContext): Promise<ConversationResponse>

  // Specialized handlers for each conversation stage
  private async handleGreeting(userInput, context)
  private async handleCarrierQualification(userInput, context)
  private async handleLoadDiscussion(userInput, context)
  private async handleRateNegotiation(userInput, context)
  private async handleCallClosing(userInput, context)
}
```

#### **EnhancedFreeSWITCHCallCenter** (`app/services/EnhancedFreeSWITCHCallCenter.ts`)

```typescript
// Enhanced call center with AI integration
class EnhancedFreeSWITCHCallCenter extends FreeSWITCHCallCenter {
  // AI call session management
  async handleIncomingCarrierCall(callId, carrierPhone, initialMessage)
  async processCarrierMessage(callId, message)

  // Smart transfer logic
  async transferToHuman(callId, reason)
  async provideContextToAgent(callId, session)
}
```

### **2. API Endpoints**

#### **Voice Conversation API** (`/api/ai/voice-conversation`)

```typescript
POST /api/ai/voice-conversation
// Process carrier conversation in real-time
{
  "callId": "CALL-001",
  "userInput": "Hi, I'm looking for loads going to California",
  "context": { /* call context */ }
}

GET /api/ai/voice-conversation?callId=CALL-001
// Get call context and status

PUT /api/ai/voice-conversation
// Manual transfer to human

DELETE /api/ai/voice-conversation?callId=CALL-001
// Clean up call session
```

#### **Call Center Metrics API** (`/api/ai/call-center/metrics`)

```typescript
GET /api/ai/call-center/metrics
// Get comprehensive AI call center performance metrics
{
  "aiHandledCalls": 47,
  "aiSuccessRate": 0.89,
  "transferRate": 0.11,
  "carrierSatisfaction": 4.3,
  "competitiveMetrics": { /* vs Parade.ai */ }
}
```

### **3. Dashboard Components**

#### **EnhancedAICallCenterDashboard** (`app/components/EnhancedAICallCenterDashboard.tsx`)

- Real-time active call sessions
- AI performance metrics
- Transfer reason analysis
- Competitive benchmarking vs Parade.ai

## 🎯 **Conversation Flow Examples**

### **Example 1: Carrier Qualification**

```
Carrier: "Hi, this is John from ABC Trucking, MC-123456"
AI: "Hello John! I'm FleetFlow's AI assistant. I see you're with ABC Trucking, MC-123456. Let me verify that information... Great! Your authority is active and insurance is current. What can I help you with today?"

Carrier: "Looking for loads going west from Chicago"
AI: "Perfect! I have several westbound loads from the Chicago area. Your equipment shows dry van and flatbed - is that correct? And what's your current location?"
```

### **Example 2: Load Matching & Rate Negotiation**

```
AI: "I have an excellent match for you - electronics load from Chicago to Los Angeles, 45,000 lbs, dry van. Pickup tomorrow, delivery in 2 days. The rate is $2,850 all-in."

Carrier: "That's a bit low, I was thinking more like $3,200"
AI: "I understand. Looking at current market rates for this lane, the average is $2,950. I can go up to $3,000 considering your excellent safety rating and this being a time-sensitive load. Would that work?"

Carrier: "That's fair, I'll take it"
AI: "Excellent! I'll get the load confirmation sent to you right away..."
```
