# üöõ‚ö° Go With the Flow API Documentation

## Overview

The Go With the Flow API provides Uber-like freight matching functionality with real-time load
assignment, driver management, and instant pricing.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:3000/api/go-with-the-flow
```

## Authentication

Currently uses demo authentication. In production, all endpoints would require proper authentication
tokens.

## üß™ Testing

Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints:

```bash
# Get instant loads for driver
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/go-with-the-flow/driver?action=instant-loads&driverId=driver-1"

# Request a truck
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/go-with-the-flow/shipper" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "request-truck",
    "loadRequest": {
      "origin": "Dallas, TX",
      "destination": "Houston, TX",
      "equipmentType": "Dry Van",
      "weight": 20000,
      "urgency": "high",
      "pickupDate": "2024-08-08T10:00:00Z",
      "deliveryDate": "2024-08-08T18:00:00Z",
      "shipperId": "test-shipper"
    }
  }'
