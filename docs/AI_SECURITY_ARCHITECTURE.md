# FleetFlow AI Security Architecture

This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture implemented for ALL AI components
within FleetFlow, protecting every AI-powered feature across the entire application.

## Architecture Overview

The AI security architecture is built on several key components that work together to provide
comprehensive protection:

## Core Security Components

### 1. AI Security Service

The central component that enforces security policies across all AI operations. It provides:

- **Prompt Injection Detection**: Identifies and blocks attempts to manipulate AI systems through
  malicious prompts
- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Automatically detects and redacts sensitive information in prompts
  and responses
- **Access Control Integration**: Enforces role-based access to AI capabilities
- **Policy-Based Security**: Applies configurable security policies to different AI operations
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Records all AI operations for compliance and security monitoring

### 2. Security Policies

FleetFlow implements a comprehensive set of configurable security policies for different AI
operations across the entire application:

#### Global Default Policy

Applied to all AI operations unless overridden by a more specific policy:

```json
{
  "id": "policy_global_default",

}
```

### 3. API Security Middleware

Middleware that protects all AI-related API routes:

- Intercepts and validates all AI-related requests
- Applies appropriate security policies based on operation type
- Sanitizes inputs to prevent prompt injection and data leakage
- Adds security audit information to request/response cycle
- Blocks unauthorized or potentially harmful operations

### 4. Security Dashboard

Administrative interface for security monitoring and management:

- Real-time visibility into AI operations and security events
- Policy management and configuration
- Comprehensive audit logs for compliance and forensics
- Security analytics and reporting

## AI Security Across FleetFlow

FleetFlow implements comprehensive security controls across all AI components in the application:

### Customer Service AI

AI-powered customer service features are protected with:

1. Sentiment analysis to detect and flag potentially negative or inappropriate responses
2. PII detection and redaction in customer communications
3. Role-based access to ensure only authorized personnel can use AI customer service tools
4. Validation of response templates to prevent unauthorized offers or commitments

### Logistics & Dispatch AI

AI-powered logistics and dispatch features are secured with:

1. Validation of route optimization requests to prevent data leakage
2. Protection of driver personal information in recommendations
3. Role-based access to ensure only authorized personnel can use AI logistics tools
4. Validation of load matching algorithms to prevent bias or manipulation

### Finance & Accounting AI

AI-powered financial features are protected with:

1. Detection of potentially problematic financial operations
2. Masking of sensitive financial data in analysis requests
3. Role-based access to ensure only authorized personnel can use AI financial tools
4. Validation of expense categorization to prevent fraud

### BROKERSNAPSHOT Integration Security

The BROKERSNAPSHOT integration has specific security controls:

#### Automated Review Posting

When carriers/drivers are 60+ days late on payments, the system automatically posts negative reviews
to BROKERSNAPSHOT. These automated reviews undergo security validation to ensure:

1. No sensitive payment information is leaked (account numbers, routing numbers)
2. No personally identifiable information (PII) is included
3. Comments are professional and factual, focusing only on payment behavior
4. All reviews are properly logged for audit purposes

#### Manual Review Management

When staff manually post or remove reviews, additional security controls are applied:

1. Role-based access control ensures only authorized personnel can post/remove reviews
2. All review content is validated against prompt injection and data leakage rules
3. Removal reasons are validated to prevent abuse
4. Comprehensive audit logging records all actions

## Sensitive Data Protection

The system automatically detects and redacts several types of sensitive information:

- Social Security Numbers (SSN)
- Credit Card Numbers
- API Keys and Tokens
- Email Addresses
- Phone Numbers
- MC Numbers (when used in inappropriate contexts)
- DOT Numbers (when used in inappropriate contexts)
- Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN)

## Prompt Injection Protection

The system detects and blocks common prompt injection techniques:

- Attempts to override previous instructions
- Commands to ignore security controls
- Attempts to change system behavior
- Malicious prompt engineering techniques

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always use the AISecurityService**: Never bypass security controls by directly implementing AI
   features without using the security service.

2. **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Only request the minimum permissions needed for each
   AI operation.

3. **Validate all inputs**: Even with the security service in place, validate inputs at the
   application level.

4. **Use sanitized outputs**: Always use the sanitized versions of prompts and data returned by the
   security service.

5. **Monitor audit logs**: Regularly review AI security audit logs for unusual patterns or potential
   security issues.

### For Administrators

1. **Regularly review security policies**: Keep policies updated as new features and threats emerge.

2. **Monitor the security dashboard**: Check for blocked operations and security warnings.

3. **Conduct security training**: Ensure all staff understand AI security risks and proper usage.

4. **Implement role-based access**: Limit AI capabilities to only those who need them.

5. **Enable comprehensive auditing**: Maintain detailed logs for compliance and security monitoring.

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. The security service will automatically block high-risk operations
2. Security alerts will be generated for manual review
3. Detailed audit logs will be available for forensic analysis
4. The affected AI component can be temporarily disabled if necessary

## Compliance Considerations

The AI security architecture helps meet requirements for:

- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- GDPR data protection requirements
- CCPA compliance
- PCI DSS (for payment-related operations)
- Industry-specific regulations

## Future Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:

1. Real-time security alerting for critical violations
2. Automated security testing for AI components
3. Enhanced semantic analysis for more sophisticated threat detection
4. Integration with third-party security monitoring tools
5. Advanced anomaly detection for AI operations
