## üõ†Ô∏è SQUARE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Create Categories in Square

1. Go to Square Dashboard ‚Üí Items & Services ‚Üí Categories
2. Create these categories:
   - FleetFlow Main Plans
   - FleetFlow Team Plans
   - FleetFlow Phone Add-Ons
   - FleetFlow Add-On Modules
   - FleetFlow AI Add-Ons
   - FleetFlow Enterprise Solutions
   - FleetFlow Marketplace Plans

### Step 2: Create Library Items

1. Go to Items & Services ‚Üí Item Library
2. Click "Create Item" for each subscription
3. Use the descriptions provided above
4. Set correct category and SKU
5. Save each item

### Step 3: Create Subscription Plans

1. Go to Items & Services ‚Üí Subscription Plans
2. Click "Create Plan" for each main subscription
3. Select corresponding Library Item
4. Set billing frequency to Monthly
5. **For Trial Periods (if available in your Square account):**
   - Look for "Trial Period" or "Free Trial" section
   - Set trial length in days
   - Note: Trial availability depends on your Square business type
6. Save each plan

### Step 4: Update FleetFlow Code

After creating plans in Square, update your subscription plans configuration with the Square Plan
IDs.

---

## üéØ **TRIAL PERIOD CONFIGURATION**

### **How Trial Periods Work in FleetFlow + Square:**

**‚úÖ FleetFlow Handles Trials (Recommended):**

- FleetFlow automatically creates **14-day trial periods** for new subscriptions
- Trial status is tracked in FleetFlow database
- Square billing starts after trial ends
- More flexible trial management

**FleetFlow Trial Code:**

```typescript
// Creates 14-day trial automatically
const trialEnd = new Date();
trialEnd.setDate(trialEnd.getDate() + 14);

const subscription: UserSubscription = {
  id: `sub_${Date.now()}_${userId}`,
  status: 'trial',  // Trial status
  currentPeriodEnd: trialEnd,
  trialEnd,
  // ... other config
};
```

**‚ùå Square Trial Periods (Limited & Variable):**

- Square subscription plans **may** have trial periods
- **Availability depends on your Square business type and location**
- Trial settings are in plan creation/editing, but not all accounts have access
- Square trials are fixed duration per plan (can't be customized per customer)
- Some business types don't support subscription trials at all

### **Recommendation: Use FleetFlow Trials**

- ‚úÖ **Always available** - works regardless of Square account type
- ‚úÖ More flexible trial management per customer
- ‚úÖ Trial status integrated with user permissions
- ‚úÖ Can modify trial length dynamically
- ‚úÖ Better integration with your existing FleetFlow code
- ‚úÖ Not dependent on Square's trial limitations

**If Square trials are available in your account:**

1. When creating/editing subscription plan
2. Look for "Trial Period", "Free Trial", or "Trial Length" field
3. Set trial duration in days
4. **Note**: This overrides FleetFlow trial logic
5. Test thoroughly as Square trial behavior may vary by account type

// Example: 'dispatcher' ‚Üí 'dispatcher-annual'
// Pricing: $79/month ‚Üí $790/year (2 months free!)
```
