# IMMEDIATE PRIVACY POLICY SOLUTION FOR PLAID

## Quick Fix - Use GitHub Pages

Since your domain has deployment issues, here's an immediate solution:

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** called `fleetflow-privacy` (takes 2 minutes)
2. **Upload the privacy-policy.html file** I created to that repo
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in the repo settings
4. **Use this URL for Plaid:**
   `https://yourusername.github.io/fleetflow-privacy/privacy-policy.html`

## Alternative: Use Vercel Direct Deploy

1. Go to vercel.com
2. Create new project
3. Upload just the privacy-policy.html file
4. Deploy (takes 30 seconds)
5. Use the generated URL for Plaid

## Content Ready

The privacy-policy.html file I created in your /public folder contains:

- All required legal sections
- FleetFlow branding
- Proper contact information
- GDPR/CCPA compliant content

## Fastest Solution (5 minutes):

1. Create new repo on GitHub
2. Upload public/privacy-policy.html
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Give Plaid the GitHub Pages URL

This will work immediately while you fix your main domain deployment.
