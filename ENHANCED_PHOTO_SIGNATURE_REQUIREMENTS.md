## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Photo Upload Validation**
```typescript
// Pickup Completion Validation
if (!data.pickupPhotos || data.pickupPhotos.length < 2) {
  errors.push('Minimum 2 photos required at pickup (loaded truck & BOL)');
}

// Delivery Completion Validation  
if (!data.deliveryPhotos || data.deliveryPhotos.length < 2) {
  errors.push('Minimum 2 photos required at delivery (unloaded truck & delivery receipt)');
}
```

### **Receiver Signature Validation**
```typescript
// Required unless override approved
if (!data.receiverSignature && !data.overrideApproved) {
  errors.push('Receiver signature required (or override approval needed)');
}

if (!data.receiverName && !data.overrideApproved) {
  errors.push('Receiver name required (or override approval needed)');
}

// Override reason required when using override
if (data.overrideApproved && !data.overrideReason) {
  errors.push('Override reason required when signature/name override is used');
}
```

### **Real-time Upload Progress**
- Visual progress indicators during upload
- Success/error feedback
- Photo count validation
- Cloudinary integration with progress tracking
