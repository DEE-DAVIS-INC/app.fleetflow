- Used in all API calls
- Public (safe to use in frontend)

### **API Key:**
- Public identifier for your account
- Used for authenticated requests
- Safe to use in frontend

### **API Secret:**
- Private key for server-side operations
- NEVER expose in frontend code
- Used for file deletion and admin tasks

### **Upload Preset:**
- Pre-configured upload settings
- "Unsigned" means frontend can upload directly
- "fleetflow_photos" is our custom preset name

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Can't find credentials?**
- Look for "Dashboard" or "Console" in navigation
- Credentials are usually on the main dashboard page
- Try refreshing the page after login

### **API Secret shows [Hidden]?**
- Click the "Show" or "👁️" button next to it
- You might need to enter your password again

### **Upload preset not working?**
- Make sure "Signing mode" is set to "Unsigned"
- Double-check the preset name is exactly "fleetflow_photos"
- Folder should be "fleetflow/" (with trailing slash)

### **Environment variables not updating?**
- Make sure you save the .env.local file
- Restart your development server: npm run dev
- Check for typos in variable names

---
