# Simulate workflow step completion with EDI generation
echo "🔄 Simulating Driver Workflow Steps:"
echo

echo "1. 📋 Driver confirms load assignment"
echo "   → Generating EDI 990 (Response to Load Tender)..."
echo "   ✅ EDI 990 generated and queued for transmission"
echo

echo "2. ✍️  Driver verifies rate confirmation"
echo "   → Generating EDI 204 (Load Tender Response)..."
echo "   ✅ EDI 204 generated and sent to trading partner"
echo

echo "3. 📍 Driver arrives at pickup location"
echo "   → Generating EDI 214 (Shipment Status - Arrived at pickup)..."
echo "   ✅ EDI 214 sent with status code 'A1'"
echo

echo "4. 🚛 Driver completes pickup and departs"
echo "   → Generating EDI 214 (Shipment Status - Departed from pickup)..."
echo "   ✅ EDI 214 sent with status code 'AF'"
