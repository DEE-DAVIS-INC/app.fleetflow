# ðŸ¤– AI Flow Subscription Model - Comprehensive Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why AI Flow Needs Its Own Subscription**

### **Business Rationale**

- **AI services cost 10x more to operate** than traditional TMS features (GPU compute, ML inference)
- **Usage patterns vary dramatically** - some users need minimal AI, others run thousands of
  automations daily
- **Different value proposition** - AI automation is a specialized service, not just a feature
- **Competitive positioning** - AI Flow competes directly with automation platforms like Zapier,
  Workato

### **Technical Considerations**

- **Resource intensive** - AI operations require dedicated infrastructure
- **Scalable pricing** - Usage-based models work better for AI workloads
- **Feature complexity** - AI capabilities are sophisticated enough to warrant separate plans
