## **📚 LESSON 2: FreeSWITCH Integration Mastery**

### **📞 What is FreeSWITCH?**

**FreeSWITCH** is FleetFlow's enterprise call center platform that:

- **Routes leads** to appropriate departments
- **Scores leads** for priority handling
- **Manages call queues** for optimal efficiency
- **Integrates with CRM** for complete lead tracking

### **🎯 Sales Queue Operations**

**Your Queue:** `sales_queue` **Strategy:** `longest-idle-agent` (30-second timeout) **Priority
Level:** `1` (Highest priority)

### **📊 Lead Scoring Algorithm**

FreeSWITCH automatically scores leads and routes high-value prospects to sales:

**Lead Source Scoring:**

- **Government Contracts**: 90 points → `government_queue` (sales handles these)
- **Marketplace Leads**: 85 points → `sales_queue`
- **High-Score Leads**: 80+ points → `sales_queue`
- **Inbound Inquiries**: 80 points → `sales_queue`
- **Referrals**: 70 points → `sales_queue`

**Additional Scoring Factors:**

- **Company Size**: +20 points (100+ employees)
- **Industry**: +15 points (manufacturing, retail, automotive)
- **Geography**: +10 points (high-value states: CA, TX, NY, FL, IL)
- **Urgency**: +25 points (immediate needs)

### **🔧 Using FreeSWITCH as a Sales Agent**

#### **Step 1: Agent Login**

```
1. Access FreeSWITCH dialer (AI Flow → Call Center)
2. Set status to "Available"
3. Verify queue assignment (sales_queue)
4. Check lead pipeline
```

#### **Step 2: Receiving Routed Calls**

When FreeSWITCH routes a lead to you:

- **Lead information** displays automatically
- **Scoring details** show lead priority
- **Source context** provides background
- **CRM integration** shows any existing data

#### **Step 3: Lead Qualification Process**

**BANT Qualification Framework:**

- **B**udget: Do they have funding?
- **A**uthority: Are they the decision maker?
- **N**eed: Do they have a genuine requirement?
- **T**imeline: When do they need service?

#### **Step 4: CRM Integration**

All calls automatically create:

- **Lead record** in CRM
- **Activity log** of conversation
- **Follow-up tasks** based on outcome
- **Pipeline opportunity** if qualified

### **🎯 Sales Conversion Workflow**

```
📞 Lead Receives Call → 🎯 BANT Qualification → 💰 Quote Generation → 🤝 Deal Closing
                                ↓
