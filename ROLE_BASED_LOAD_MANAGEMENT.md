# Role-Based Load Management Correction

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Removed Load Upload from Dispatch Central**

**Issue:** Dispatch Central had a "Load Upload & Dispatch" section that allowed dispatchers to create new loads, which violates the proper workflow.

**Correction:** 
- Removed `LoadUpload` component from Dispatch Central (`app/dispatch/page.tsx`)
- Removed the import statement for LoadUpload
- Replaced the load upload section with "Assigned Loads from Brokers"

### 🔄 **Updated Dispatch Central Workflow**

#### **New Structure:**
1. **Assigned Loads from Brokers** - Shows loads that broker agents have assigned to dispatch agencies
2. **Dispatch Coordination Board** - Clarified that loads come from brokers, not created internally
3. **Driver Assignment** - Focus on assigning drivers to loads received from brokers
4. **Invoice Generation** - Generate dispatch fee invoices for completed assignments

#### **Sample Assigned Loads Display:**
- Shows loads with broker information (FreightCorp, LogiTrans)
- Displays broker agent names (Sarah Johnson, Mike Chen)
- Shows dispatch fee calculation (10% of load value)
- Provides actions: "Assign Driver" and "Generate Invoice"

### 📋 **Clarified Dispatch Board**

Added informational note:
> "Loads are posted by broker agents and assigned to dispatch agencies. Use this board to coordinate driver assignments for loads assigned to your dispatch agency."

#### **Updated Load Flow:**
- **Broker Agents** post loads in Broker Command Center
- **Broker Agents** assign loads to dispatch agencies
- **Dispatchers** receive assigned loads in Dispatch Central
- **Dispatchers** assign drivers and coordinate delivery
- **Dispatchers** generate invoices for dispatch fees

### ✅ **Confirmed Broker Command Center**

Verified that `LoadUpload` component remains properly integrated in:
- **Broker Command Center** (`app/broker/page.tsx`)
- Available to broker agents for posting new loads
- Includes all freight class and pallet calculator features

## Correct Role Permissions

### 🏢 **Broker Agents:**
- ✅ Post new loads (LoadUpload component)
- ✅ Assign loads to dispatch agencies
- ✅ Manage broker agent assignments
- ✅ Generate rate confirmations and BOLs
- ✅ View load board and submit bids

### 🚚 **Dispatchers:**
- ✅ Receive loads assigned by broker agents
- ✅ Assign drivers to loads
- ✅ Generate dispatch fee invoices (10%)
- ✅ Coordinate delivery and tracking
- ✅ Manage dispatch agencies and agents
- ❌ Cannot post new loads (removed)

## System Integrity

This correction ensures:
1. **Proper separation of roles** - Brokers create, dispatchers coordinate
2. **Clear workflow** - Loads flow from brokers → dispatchers → drivers
3. **Accurate fee tracking** - Dispatch fees calculated on assigned loads
4. **Professional structure** - Mirrors real-world logistics operations

The system now properly reflects industry standards where broker agents are responsible for load creation and dispatch agencies handle the coordination and driver assignment aspects of freight management.
