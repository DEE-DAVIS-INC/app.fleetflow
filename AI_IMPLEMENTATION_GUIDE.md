## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guide

### **Step 1: Installation**

AI dependencies are already installed in your FleetFlow system:
```bash
# Dependencies included:
- openai: ^4.x.x (OpenAI API integration)
- node-cron: ^3.x.x (Scheduled automation tasks)
- axios: ^1.x.x (HTTP requests for external APIs)
```

### **Step 2: Configuration**

1. **Set up OpenAI API Key**:
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env.local file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Configure Contact Information**:
   ```bash
   # Fleet management contacts for automated alerts
   FLEET_MANAGER_PHONE=+1234567890
   FLEET_MANAGER_EMAIL=manager@fleetflow.com
   DISPATCH_PHONE=+1234567890
   HR_EMAIL=hr@fleetflow.com
   MANAGEMENT_EMAIL=management@fleetflow.com
   EMERGENCY_CONTACT=+1234567890
   ```

### **Step 3: Usage**

#### **Access AI Dashboard**
Navigate to `/ai` in your FleetFlow application to access the AI Automation Center.

#### **Start Automation Engine**
```typescript
import { aiAutomation } from './services/automation-engine';

// Start all automated AI tasks
aiAutomation.start();

// Stop automation if needed
aiAutomation.stop();
```

#### **Manual AI Analysis**
```typescript
import { fleetAI } from './services/ai';

// Route optimization
const routeOptimization = await fleetAI.optimizeRoute(vehicles, destinations);

// Predictive maintenance
const maintenanceAnalysis = await fleetAI.predictMaintenance(vehicleData);

// Driver performance analysis
const driverAnalysis = await fleetAI.analyzeDriverPerformance(driverData);

// Cost optimization
const costOptimization = await fleetAI.optimizeCosts(fleetData);
```
