### **🛠️ Technical Integration Approach**

```typescript
// Example: How new multimodal service integrates with existing systems
class ComprehensiveTMSOrchestrator {
  constructor() {
    // NEW: Multimodal capabilities
    this.multimodalService = new MultimodalTransportService();
    this.dockSchedulingService = new AIDockSchedulingService();
    this.settlementProcessor = new AISettlementProcessor();

    // EXISTING: FleetFlow systems (enhanced, not replaced)
    this.existingOrchestrator = new FleetFlowSystemOrchestrator();
    this.automationEngine = new AIAutomationEngine();
    this.routeOptimizer = new RouteOptimizationService();
  }

  // NEW: Comprehensive workflow that uses BOTH new and existing
  async orchestrateShipment(request) {
    // 1. NEW: Get multimodal options
    const quotes = await this.multimodalService.getMultimodalQuotes(request);

    // 2. NEW: AI mode selection
    const selectedMode = await this.selectOptimalMode(quotes);

    // 3. EXISTING: Use current load management if truckload
    if (selectedMode.mode === 'truckload') {
      const existingLoad = await this.existingOrchestrator.processLoad(request);
      // Seamless integration without duplication
    }

    // 4. NEW: Enhanced scheduling with existing integration
    const appointments = await this.scheduleWithExistingSystem(selectedMode);

    // 5. EXISTING: Use current notification system enhanced with new data
    await this.existingOrchestrator.sendNotifications(enhancedData);
  }
}
```
