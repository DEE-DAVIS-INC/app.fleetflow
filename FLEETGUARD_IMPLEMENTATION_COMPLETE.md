## 🎯 **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Address Validation & Fraud Detection**

```typescript
// Detects virtual offices, PO boxes, residential addresses
const addressRisk = await addressValidator.validateBusinessAddress(carrier.address);

// Identifies:
// - Virtual office addresses
// - PO Box addresses
// - Mail forwarding services
// - Residential addresses for business
// - Low geocoding confidence
```

### **2. AI-Powered Document Analysis**

```typescript
// Uses existing Claude AI for document authenticity
const docAnalysis = await documentAnalyzer.analyzeDocumentAuthenticity(document);

// Detects:
// - Digital manipulation
// - Format inconsistencies
// - Suspicious patterns
// - Data accuracy issues
// - Document quality problems
```

### **3. Behavioral Pattern Recognition**

```typescript
// Analyzes carrier submission patterns
const behaviorAnalysis = await behaviorAnalyzer.analyzeSubmissionPatterns(carrier);

// Identifies:
// - Unusually fast submissions
// - Poor data quality patterns
// - Inconsistent information
// - Suspicious response patterns
// - Document completeness issues
```

### **4. Comprehensive Risk Assessment**

```typescript
// 5-factor risk scoring system
const fraudRisk = await fraudGuard.assessFraudRisk(carrierData);

// Risk Factors:
// - Address Risk (30% weight)
// - Business Risk (30% weight)
// - FMCSA Risk (40% weight)
// - Document Risk (enhanced later)
// - Behavior Risk (enhanced later)
```

### **5. Enhanced Carrier Scoring**

```typescript
// Combines performance + fraud risk
const enhancedScore = await fraudGuard.getEnhancedScore(carrierData);

// Scoring:
// - Performance Score (70% weight)
// - Fraud Risk (30% weight)
// - Risk-Adjusted Score
// - Approval Recommendation
// - Confidence Metrics
```
