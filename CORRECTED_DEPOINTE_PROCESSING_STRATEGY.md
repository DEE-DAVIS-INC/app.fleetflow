# üöõ CORRECTED: DEPOINTE Processing Strategy

## The Real Way to Become a Registration Service Provider

### **üö® IMPORTANT CORRECTION**

**You're absolutely right!** There is NO special "third-party agent registration" with FMCSA through
Login.gov. I was incorrect about that process. Here's what DEPOINTE can actually do:

---

## üéØ **What DEPOINTE Can Actually Offer**

### **Service 1: MC Authority Registration Assistance (Consultation Model)**

```consultation_model
üéØ **FMCSA Registration Consultation Service:**

**How It Actually Works:**
- **Students create their own Login.gov accounts** (required by FMCSA)
- **Students submit their own applications** through URS system
- **DEPOINTE provides expert guidance** throughout the process
- **DEPOINTE handles document preparation** and application review
- **DEPOINTE monitors status** and provides updates

**DEPOINTE's Value-Add:**
- Complete application preparation and review
- Document collection and organization
- FMCSA system navigation guidance
- Status monitoring and communication
- Issue resolution and follow-up support
- Compliance guidance and education

**Revenue Model:**
- Service fee: $800-1,200 per student
- FMCSA fee: $300 (student pays directly)
- Net profit: $800-1,200 per student
- Annual potential: $160K-600K (200-500 students)
```

### **Service 2: BOC-3 Process Agent Service (Physical Presence Required)**

```process_agent_reality
üìã **BOC-3 Process Agent Service Requirements:**

**What's Actually Required:**
- **Physical address in EVERY state** where providing service
- **Available during business hours** to receive legal documents
- **Not a P.O. Box** - must be actual physical presence
- **Register as process agent** with FMCSA in each state

**Two Realistic Options:**

**Option A: Partner with Existing Blanket Process Agent**
- Work with established providers (CT Corporation, CSC, etc.)
- Offer as part of LaunchPad package
- Earn referral commissions (10-20%)
- No setup costs or physical presence required

**Option B: Limited State Coverage**
- Establish physical presence in top 10-15 freight states
- Use virtual offices with mail forwarding
- Partner with existing agents for remaining states
- Hybrid model for cost-effective coverage
```
